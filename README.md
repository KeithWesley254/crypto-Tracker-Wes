# Description:

TXC Clan Crypto is an application inspired by the rise of cryptocurrencies. 

The application is aimed at giving relevant up to date information on everything related to cryptocurrencies. More features will be implemented in the future such as information on different owners and other investment areas.

As Head of TXC Clan you can reach out for requests or any other relevant information

# Instructions:
1. The Crypto Tracker at the top is the home button that will navigate to the home page.
2. Click on a coin to see more information about it such as its rank and price over a period of time.
3. You can change the currency to see price and market cap in either dollars or bitcoin.
4. Leave us your feedback on other tools you would like to see implemented to streamline your experience.

# API(s) used:

I used only one API for this application as they have all the necessary endpoints to make it a success.
